# Chip-8 Emulator in _RUST_
Yet another Chip-8 emulator - this time in _RUST_ ðŸ¦€.
WHAT A CONCEPT.

The spec was based on the brilliant document from [Cowgods brilliantly clear specification](http://devernay.free.fr/hacks/chip8/C8TECH10.HTM#2.1)

## Implemented
- 23/35 instructions
- Basic Memory structure
- Basic execution of instructions

## Todo
- Implement the rest of the instructions
- Implement a display
- - For the emulators output
- - For viewing the internal state of the CPU
- Perhaps support for a basic assembly language? ðŸ‘€
